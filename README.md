## Reflection: Plastic Arts

During the transcurse of these last semesters and specially my fist IB year, I have
been focusing on different artistics proyects that involve different thechinques, methods,
and themes.

The area of creativity has been a great opportunity to develop my skills on activities and 
hobbies that I have passion for. Trough art I am able to find different perspectives on the
world that I would not find either way. Art is something that forces you to think outside the
box, explore topics that may be uncomfortable but that offer a variety of ideas and knowledge.

One of my favorite projects for Plastic Arts is the "Day of the Death" exhibition, where we
explore the tematic of these festive days that are very exclusive to the culture of Mexico.

In a way, I must recognize my areas of opportunity being time management one of them. Due to the
hours spent on these types of work, they are normally left unfinished and I am aware that 
improvement is needed.

## Reflection: Calisthemnics

Calisthemnics is a sport that requires a lot of dedication and discipline. I have been praticing 
it for almost one year now, and we could consider many of its benefits as a result of the effort
made. As mentioned before, developing this kind of sports are a very reliable and nice way to
develop habits that lead into a healthy lifestyle.

## Reflection: For a safe return to school

During the transcurse of November 16th to November 19th, 2021 I am willing to participate in voluntary practices for public 
schools that have an association towards Tec de Monterrey. The main objectives of these activities will be to participate in 
capactitations in order to transfer knwoledge for valuable areas such as sanitary measures, stress management, and expression 
of emotions.

My role is to participate on eight sessions of one hour each under the name of "Cuida tu mente" or caring for your mind. Trough
these, we will be proporcionating tools foward management the pshycological effects, and stress that are a consequence of the 
current pandemic. The main approach will be parents, teachers, and directors since we believe they are the most vulnerable towards
these situations.
